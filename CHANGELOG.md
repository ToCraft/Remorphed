remorphed 3.0
================

First of all, this update is required to make the mod work with Woodwalkers v3+.
Furthermore, this implements a feature which was originally introduced by identity- entity favourites! I hope you like
the implementation.
Of course, I've also fixed the search-algorithm, so you can search for toolbox infos, too.
There is also a brand new config option to change "killToUnlock" values per entity type.
Last but not least, the Special Shape implementation is way more advanced, you consider to donate to check it out ;D.
As always, there are some background improvements, too.
