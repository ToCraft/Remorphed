### Transform into a mob!

This mod allows you to unlock a mobs as shapes by killing them.

## Getting Started

It's rather easy- just search for a mob in the wilderniss and kill it. After killing it, you're able to select it in the Menu (open it by pressing `^`). After selecting it, you can transform into it, just like in the Woodwalkers-mod, by pressing `G`.
