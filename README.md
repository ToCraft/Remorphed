### Kill mobs to transform into them!

This mod allows you to unlock mobs as shapes by killing them.

## Getting Started

Search for a mob in the wilderniss and kill it. After killing it, you're able to select it in the Menu (open it by
pressing `^`). After selecting it, you can transform into it, just like in the Woodwalkers-mod, by pressing `G`.
**Note: The previous unlocking method from Woodwalkers doesn't work with this addon installed! This unlock mechanic
works as a replacement.**
