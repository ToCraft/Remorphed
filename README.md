# ReMorphed

ReMorphed is a morph-like mod based on Identity which aims to bring the well-known kill-to-unlock method to new
minecraft versions.

<strong>This features a menu (what walkers doesn't), new unlock-mechanics and the possibility of more than two
shape!</strong>

> This mod is also compatible with [SkinShifter](https://github.com/ToCraft/SkinShifter/), where you can transform into
> other players!

### Kill mobs to transform into them!

This mod allows you to unlock mobs as shapes by killing them.

## Getting Started

Search for a mob in the wilderness and kill it. After killing it, you're able to select it in the Menu (open it by
pressing `^`). After selecting it, you can transform into it, just like in the Woodwalkers-mod, by pressing `G`.
**Note: The previous unlocking method from Woodwalkers doesn't work with this addon installed! This unlock mechanic
works as a replacement.**
